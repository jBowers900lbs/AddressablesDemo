# Demo Pitch

## Summary
The goal of this demo, is to showcase the capabilities of Addressables in a production environment. Some of these key points to be demonstrated are as followed, 

1.  Showcase "loading bar" for initial asset loads when the application starts. 
2. Instantiate 3D assets from a local and remote address at runtime
	1. While also handling their destruction, clearing up memory.
3. Instantiate and unload different assetbundles based on selection at runtime. (_Similar to multi-ship loading/unloading on RCCL-SCC_)
4. Utilize performance tracking for visible results

## Packages
- Unity Addressables
- Ultimate FPS Counter
